2. The definition of free software consists of four freedoms (freedoms 0 through 3). 
Which of the following is NOT one of the freedoms that are part of the definition? 
Select all that apply.

- The freedom to restrict access to the source code for the software
- The freedom to prevent users from using the software for undesirable purposes.
- The freedom to sell the software for any price.

3. In R the following are all atomic data types EXCEPT: (Select all that apply)

- matrix
- array
- list
- table
- data frame

4. If I execute the expression x <- 4L in R, what is the class of the object 'x' as 
determined by the 'class()' function?

- integer

#4. If I execute the expression x <- 4 in R, what is the class of the object 'x' as 
determined by the 'class()' function?

- numeric 

5. What is the class of the object defined by the expression x <- c(4, "a", TRUE)?

- character

#5. What is the class of the object defined by x <- c(4, TRUE)?

- numeric

6. If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), 
what is produced by the expression rbind(x, y)?

- a matrix with two rows and three columns

7. A key property of vectors in R is that

- elements of a vector all must be of the same class.

8. Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). 
What does x[[2]] give me? Select all that apply.

- a character vector containing the letter "a".
- a character vector of length 1

9. Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and y <- 2. What is produced by the expression x + y?

- an numeric vector with the values 3,4,5,6

10. Suppose I have a vector x <- c(3, 5, 1, 10, 12, 6) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are less than 6 to be equal to zero. 
What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.

- x[x %in% 1:5] <- 0
- x[x < 6] <- 0
- x[x <= 5] <- 0

#10. Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 
to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.

- x[x >= 11] <- 4
- x[x > 10] <- 4

11. In the dataset provided for this Quiz, what are the column names of the dataset?

- Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, Temp, Month, Day

12. Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. 
What does the output look like?

code :
      data[c(1,2),c(1:6)]

13. How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?

- 153

14. Extract the last 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. 
What does the output look like?

code :
       tail(data,2)

15. What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?

- 21

16. How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?

- 37

17. What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.

- 42.1

18. Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90.
 What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?

- 212.8

19. What is the mean of "Temp" when "Month" is equal to 6?

- 79.1

20. What was the maximum ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month is equal to 5)?

- 115
